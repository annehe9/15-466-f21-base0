# Bing Bong Pong

**Author:** Anne He

**Design:** A chaotic game about bouncy balls. Press the correct key at the correct time to bounce the balls, otherwise they fall into ***the abyss***. The keys make fun sounds for maximum chaos. The more points you score the more balls appear. How many balls can you juggle?

**How To Play:**

ASDF to activate the not-paddles. You have 10 lives shown on the right. You lose lives by dropping balls. When you lose all lives and drop your last ball, the game ends. Your score displays on the left.

You could button mash but this is not recommended. The game is designed with sound to discourage you from button mashing.

**Sources:** 

Used https://github.com/15-466/15-466-f21-base0 source code, and ideas from the 15-466 Timing lesson. 

Sound was my original inspiration so I took the sound code and loading code from last year's game 3, https://github.com/15-466/15-466-f20-base3.

Sounds sampled from "Bing-bong , bong-bing ( like peripheral plugged-unplugged).flac" by Timbre, https://freesound.org/people/Timbre/sounds/232210/. Modified by me in Audacity.

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
